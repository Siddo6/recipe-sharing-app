Recipe App

### Overview
This is my first ever project, and while the UI might not be perfect, 
it represents the early stages of my learning journey. Over time, I've significantly improved my front-end skills,
 and I'm proud of the solid backend functionality I've built into this application.
The Recipe App allows users to share and discover new recipes. 
Users can post their own recipes, explore othersâ€™ creations, leave comments. 

### Features
